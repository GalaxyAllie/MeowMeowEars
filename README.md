# Meow Meow Ears
This is a project to create a pair of programmable neko mimis that feature ten LEDs.
## v1
This is essentially a light strip on a cat ear shaped PCB.
## v2
This adds ATSAMD21 microcontroller.
## v3
This will be focussed on refining the design, art and functionality. I may move to a TI microcontroller with on board BLE, but that's a big step in the future.
